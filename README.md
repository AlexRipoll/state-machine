# State Machine

This project consists of a basic Polkadot-like state machine. It is designed as a tutorial to help you understand the foundational concepts of building a state machine using Rust.

## Project Overview

The project aims to replicate the core functionality of a Polkadot-like state machine, providing a simplified model that is easy to understand and extend. Through this tutorial, you will gain insights into:

- Building state machines in Rust
- Managing state transitions
- Implementing basic functionalities similar to those found in the Polkadot network

## Tutorial

This project is part of a tutorial from DotCodeSchool. The detailed step-by-step guide can be found here:
